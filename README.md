# pandas-analysis-techniques

This is an assignment for UNCC's data analytics bootcamp. Data for students and their test scores are provided, along with information about the schools in a district. Various data frames are created to seek trends within the data, and a brief analysis is included at the end of the jupyter notebook. Summary tables include:

* Summary dataframes for schools and the entire district including average test scores, type, student count and budget

* Rankings of the five best and five worst schools in the district based on the percentage of students passing both reading and math standardized tests

* A breakdown of average test scores based on grade level for all schools in the district

* A breakdown of average test scores based on various levels of spending per student

* A breakdown of average test scores based on the size of the school (small, medium or large)

* A comparison of average standardized test scores for charter schools versus regular district high schools
